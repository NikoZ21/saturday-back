# General Rules for Agent Mode

## 1. Question-First Approach

When I ask a question in Agent mode:

- **Answer the question first** - provide explanation, guidance, or information
- **Ask if I want implementation** - don't automatically start generating code
- Wait for confirmation before making any code changes

## 2. Stick to the Specification

- **Do ONLY the specified work** - don't add extra features or make additional changes
- **Ask before doing anything extra** - if you come up with a better solution or want to add extra functionality, ask me first
- Get explicit approval before deviating from the original request

## 3. Configuration Files

- **NEVER modify configuration files** - do not configure or change `appsettings.json`, `appsettings.Development.json`, or any other configuration files
- Configuration files contain sensitive data and environment-specific settings that should only be managed by the user
